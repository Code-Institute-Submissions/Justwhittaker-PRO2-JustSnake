# Milestone Project JavaScript/JQuery

## JUST SNAKE

In the early 2000's as technology increased and cellphones had become more accessible with multiple capibilites.<br>
Cellphone games such as Snake came standard with your cellphone such as the popular Nokia 3110, we all tried betting our top scores.<br>

I have decided to recreate the poplular game for everyone to enjoy in both the classic format for celluar use as well as for the pc.

## UX
For the UX on this project I wanted to create a simple and user friendly site. My target audience is ages, hence I chose vibarant colors.<br>

I used Bootstrap4 to assit with the mobile friendly code to ensure that the game can be played anywhere.<br>

I wanted a seasoned gamer still to have fun, I want to perform an quick and simple game, so that I can achieve a goal.<br>
I designed my wireframe on Balsamiq please follow the link to find the preview

### User Perspectective Story
Herewith a discriptive step by step breakdown of the UX for User A:<br>
Landing page <br>
<li> When landing on the Home page the user firsts notices the bright logo & heading to know they have found the right page </li>
<li> Underneath the Logo there is a score column so that the user can quickly identify there current score, this resets when a new game starts</li>
<li> In a conveint sized canvas box is the game the starts playing immedaitely and gets the user into game mode as they land on the page.</li>
<li> Below the canvas is quick instructions so that the user can grasp the controls immedaitely.</li>
<li> The screen is very responsive and fits on all devises with no need to scroll down to read any infomation.</li>
