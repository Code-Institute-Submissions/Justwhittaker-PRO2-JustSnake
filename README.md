JUST SNAKE

In the early 2000's as technology increased and cellphones had become more accessible with multiple0 capibilites.
Cellphone games such as Snake came standard with your cellphone such as the popular Nokia 3110, we all tried betting our top scores.

I have decided to recreate the poplular game for everyone to enjoy in both the classic format for celluar use as well as for the pc.

UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
Simple, clean and basic gaming

Existing Features
Feature 1 - Score keeping
Feature 2 - memorize highscores
Feature 3 - Easy and simple snake play
...
Features Left to Implement
Another feature 1 - change color of the snake when it reaches a highscore level
another feature 2 - save highscores to a game centre to allow the user to come back to beat thier previous scores.

Technologies Used
languages - HTML5, CSS3, JQuery
framework - 
libraries and other tools - Google fonts, PNGtree.com

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
